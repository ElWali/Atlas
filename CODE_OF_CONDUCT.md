# 🌍 Atlas Code of Conduct

Atlas is a borderless, open project. Its success depends on a diverse community of developers, researchers, translators, designers, and curious explorers working together with respect and care.

This Code of Conduct outlines the standards all community members are expected to uphold.

---

## ✅ Our Pledge
We pledge to make participation in Atlas a respectful, safe, and inclusive experience for everyone, regardless of background, geographic location, language, culture, or political perspective.  

We recognize that maps touch on sensitive issues. Our pledge is to **prioritize constructive collaboration** and to focus on the shared goal: building a borderless atlas that emphasizes places, names, and nature.

## 🌐 Our Standards
Examples of behavior that support a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language  
- Respecting varying naming traditions, languages, and cultural contexts  
- Providing and receiving constructive feedback  
- Focusing criticism on processes, not people  
- Giving credit where credit is due  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Personal attacks, harassment, or discriminatory remarks  
- Disrespecting or attempting to "erase" another culture’s or community’s naming traditions  
- Political arguments over state legitimacy or borders (these are intentionally outside Atlas’s scope)  
- Any sustained disruption of discussions or work

## ✨ Naming and Cultural Neutrality
Atlas is a borderless project.  
This means:
- Multiple names (endonyms, exonyms, historical labels) are preserved rather than reduced to one "official" form.  
- Contributors should not attempt to enforce a single “correct” or “political” narrative over disputed names.  
- Disagreements are resolved by inclusion (documenting variants), not exclusion.  

---

## 🚀 Enforcement
- Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying acceptable behavior.  
- Inappropriate conduct may result in issue/PR closure, temporary bans, or removal from the community spaces.  
- Serious violations may be escalated to the core team for permanent exclusion.  

Reports of unacceptable behavior can be directed confidentially to the maintainers via the project’s contact channels (see [README.md](README.md)).

## 📜 Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, with modifications to reflect Atlas’s mission of neutrality, inclusiveness, and cultural respect.
